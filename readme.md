# 🐍 My Python Learning Journey

Welcome to my Python learning repo. This is where I document my progress, practice projects, notes, and experiments as I work toward becoming a Cloud Engineer with strong Python fundamentals.

## 🚀 Why I'm Learning Python

- To build a solid foundation for cloud engineering and DevOps work
- To write automation scripts, infrastructure as code (IaC), and tools
- To eventually build real-world, production-grade cloud projects

## 🧠 Current Focus

- Python syntax, variables, data types
- Functions, loops, conditionals
- Working with files and exceptions
- Modules, virtual environments
- Writing clean, readable code

## 🛠️ Tools

- Python 3.x
- Replit (for quick iteration)
- Git & GitHub (for version control)
- VS Code (for local development)

## 🔁 Updates

This README will evolve as my skills grow. If you're reading this and want to follow along, feel free to watch the repo or drop suggestions.
